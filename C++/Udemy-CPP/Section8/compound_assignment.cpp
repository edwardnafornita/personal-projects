    In C++ you can use compound assignment operators:
        C Standard Operators
            '+='
            '-='
            '*='
            '/='
            '%='
    C++ Operators include all of standard C operators and:
        '<<=' : leftHandSide = leftHandSide << rightHandSide;
        '>>=' : leftHandSide = leftHandSide >> rightHandSide;
        '&=' : leftHandSide = leftHandSide & rightHandSide;
        '^=' : leftHandSide = leftHandSide ^ rightHandSide;
        '|=' : leftHandSide = leftHandSide | rightHandSide;
    These ones are known as Bitwise operators.
